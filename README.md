## Abstract  

WHAT’S COOKIN is an interactive virtual repository of recipe data and instructions that makes selecting, compiling, and preparing your favorite foods as easy as a click of the mouse or a touch of the thumb! A user can use this site to browse a collection of recipes, save recipes to Favorites or a separte library called Recipes to Cook. A user also has access to a digital pantry where they can see and add to a list of ingredients in their personal pantry. This allows a user to receive feedback on individual recipes as to whether or not they have the ingredients necessary to cook that particular dish.
