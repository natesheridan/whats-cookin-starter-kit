## Abstract  

WHAT’S COOKIN is an interactive virtual repository of recipe data and instructions that makes selecting, compiling, and preparing your favorite foods as easy as a click of the mouse or a touch of the thumb! A user can use this site to browse a collection of recipes, save recipes to Favorites or a separte library called Recipes to Cook. A user also has access to a digital pantry where they can see and add to a list of ingredients in their personal pantry. This allows a user to receive feedback on individual recipes as to whether or not they have the ingredients necessary to cook that particular dish.

## Wins  

 - Organizing DOM updates into their own file 
 - Github Project Board
 - SCSS and Grid display
 - The pantry display's ability to be scrollable
 - Heroku for the deployed API
 - Successful GET and POST fetch requests

## Challenges + Improvements  

 - Correctly importing and exporting files 
 - While the POST request was sending a successful responsive, we were not seeing the update in the datao n the back-end. After consulting with another developer, we found the data being sent was a string rather than a number which resolved the issue. In future iterations, we would want to update the DOM to display the pantry with that updated information.
 - Group morale was under an incredible amount of stress with balancing final assessments, new lesson material, and completing project. This lead to some shortcuts     in code and some user stories not being fulfilled.
